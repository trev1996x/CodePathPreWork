## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Favorite apps: Crumbl, AirBnB, and AfterPay
I like all of these apps due to their clean user interface. They all use mostly simple colors, nothing that is
hard on your eyes, yet not plain. AirBnb and AfterPay both have very easily viewable search bars on the main page
as well as a navigation bar at the bottom to quickly access most-desired sections in their apps. 

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I was a bit confused on the instruction saying to toggle the Asssitant when asked to connect the 
UIButton to the ViewController logic. It needs to be a little more clear to say to toggle it on. My Mac
had it already turned on by default, so I toggled it off which made it confusing as to where I needed to drag it.
My other challenge was trying to create another button that would change the text color for my name. I searched for 
a few ways to achieve this, but some of the code seemed a bit excessive and difficult, so I left it as is.
